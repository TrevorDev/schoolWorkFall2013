1. Violates referential integrity because MgrSSN = 943775543 and there is no tuple in EMPLOYEE relation with SSN = 943775543. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the insertion of the new DEPARTMENT tuple
B. Changing the value of MgrSSN in the new DEPARTMENT to an existing SSN value in the EMPLYEE relation
C. Inserting a new EMPLYEE tuple with SSN = 943775543

2. Violates entity integrity because the new PNo = null, PNo is a primary key and no primary key value can be null. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the insertion of the new WORKS_ON tuple
B. Changing the definition of the WORKS_ON table so that PNo to no longer a primary key

3. Violates user defined integrity because now emplyee doesnt work here

4. Valid

5. Violates referential integrity because SUPERSSN = 943775543 and there is no tuple in EMPLOYEE relation with SSN = 943775543. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the modification of the new EMPLYEE tuple
B. Changing the value of SUPERSSN in the new EMPLYEE to an existing SSN value in the EMPLYEE relation
C. Inserting a new EMPLYEE tuple with SSN = 943775543
