1. Violates referential integrity because MgrSSN = 943775543 and there is no tuple in EMPLOYEE relation with SSN = 943775543. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the insertion of the new DEPARTMENT tuple
B. Changing the value of MgrSSN in the new DEPARTMENT to an existing SSN value in the EMPLYEE relation
C. Inserting a new EMPLYEE tuple with SSN = 943775543

2. Violates entity integrity because the new PNo = null, PNo is a primary key and no primary key value can be null. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the insertion of the new WORKS_ON tuple
B. Changing the definition of the WORKS_ON table so that PNo to no longer a primary key

3. Valid - However it may be unwanted to have a EMPLOYEE with no hours of work

4. Violates semantic integrity because the new MgrStartDate of 01-OCT-88 compared to the EMPLOYEE with SSN = 123456789 birthday of 09/01/80 would mean that he was manager at 8 years old which in most cases is not logical. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the modification
B. Changing the MgrStartDate to a correct later date
C. Changing EMPLOYEE with SSN = 12345678 birthday to a correct earlier date

5. Violates referential integrity because SUPERSSN = 943775543 and there is no tuple in EMPLOYEE relation with SSN = 943775543. We may inforce the constraint by:
A. Rejecting the modification of the new EMPLYEE tuple
B. Changing the value of SUPERSSN in the new EMPLYEE to an existing SSN value in the EMPLYEE relation
C. Inserting a new EMPLYEE tuple with SSN = 943775543
